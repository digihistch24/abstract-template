## Introduction

This repository hosts the standardized template for submitting extended abstracts to the Digital History Switzerland 2024 conference. It's designed to ensure uniformity in submissions, making the review process more efficient and accessible.

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is designed to be as simple as possible. The main files are:

- `abstract-template` - The root directory of the repository.
  - `_quarto.yml` - The configuration file for the Quarto project.
  - `.gitignore` - The file specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
  - `index.qmd` - The main file of the abstract.
  - `references.bib` - The BibTeX file for the references.

## Usage

Detailed instructions for using the template:

1. Follow the instructions on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to install Quarto.
2. Edit `index.qmd` with your favorite Markdown editor, turning your abstract into a [Quarto Manuscript](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/). Check the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for more information on markdown syntax.
3. Use `quarto preview abstract-template` to preview your abstract.
4. Enhance your abstract with inline code, figures, etc. at will.
5. We will collect all extended abstracts and publish them as a collection [on GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#overview) in August 2024.
