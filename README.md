## Introduction

This repository hosts the standardized template for submitting extended abstracts to the Digital History Switzerland 2024 conference. It's designed to ensure uniformity in submissions, making the review process more efficient and accessible.

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is designed to be as simple as possible. The main files are:

- `abstract-template` - The root directory of the repository.
  - `_quarto.yml` - The configuration file for the Quarto project.
  - `.gitignore` - The file specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
  - `index.qmd` - The main file of the abstract.
  - `references.bib` - The BibTeX file for the references.

## Usage

Detailed instructions for using the template:

1. Edit `index.qmd` with your favorite Markdown editor.
2. Check the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for more information on the syntax.
