## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is designed to be as simple as possible. The main files are:

- `abstract-template` - The root directory of the repository.
  - `_quarto.yml` - The configuration file for the Quarto project.
  - `.gitignore` - The file specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
  - `index.qmd` - The main file of the abstract.
  - `references.bib` - The BibTeX file for the references.

### Previewing the Abstract

Previewing your document ensures it looks correct before submission. Here is how you can preview your abstract using the Quarto CLI:

1. **Install Quarto:**
   - Follow the detailed installation instructions on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

2. **Open Your Terminal:**
   - Access your terminal or command prompt. On Windows, you can search for "cmd" or "Command Prompt" in your start menu. On macOS, open "Terminal" from your Applications/Utilities folder.

3. **Navigate to Your Repository:**
   - Use the `cd` command to change directories to the root directory of your repository, where your `index.qmd` file is located.

4. **Run the Preview Command:**
   - Type `quarto preview abstract-template` and press Enter. Quarto will start a local server and open a preview of your abstract in your default web browser.

5. **Check for Errors:**
   - If you encounter any errors during preview, refer to the Quarto documentation for troubleshooting or ask for help on the Discussions Page.

By following these enhanced instructions, users should find it easier to start working with the template, make necessary edits, and collaborate with others. These improvements aim to reduce confusion and streamline the user experience, particularly for those who may be new to using GitHub and Quarto.
